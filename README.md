# 🌐 Everchain Compute

## 📘 Project Description
Everchain Compute is a decentralized compute-task registry built on the Ethereum blockchain.  
Users can submit computation requests, store processed outputs, and retrieve task results — all transparently and securely.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To enable a trust-minimized, blockchain-based environment where compute tasks and results can be recorded, verified, and accessed without dependency on centralized servers.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Task Submission:** Users can create compute tasks with descriptive metadata.
- **Result Storage:** Submitters can store computation results immutably on-chain.
- **Task Retrieval:** Anyone can view task details, including status and results.
- **Event Logging:** Each task submission and completion emits an on-chain event.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Integration with decentralized off-chain compute networks (Chainlink Functions, EigenLayer, etc.)
- Token-based incentives for computation providers
- Reputation system for compute contributors
- Batch task processing and result verification mechanisms
- Frontend dashboard for interacting with tasks in real time
